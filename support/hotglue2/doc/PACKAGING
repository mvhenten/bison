PREPARING HOTGLUE FOR DISTRIBUTION

  * make sure the development tree matches what is in the svn (don't forget newly created files)
  * make sure all images ran through pngcrush (pngcrush -brute old.png new.png)
  * make sure all minified javascript files match their counterparts (using http://www.refresh-sf.com/yui/)
  * move default start page from doc/start to content
  * check for unwanted changes to config.inc.php (such as error_reporting or LOG_LEVEL)
  * make sure .htaccess is not being distributed and merge relevant changes back to htaccess-dist
  * also check that user-config.inc.php is not being distributed
  * make sure .svn directories are not being distributed
  * make sure to bump the version number in config.inc.php and Doxyfile
  * update doxygen documentation (cd doc && doxygen) - make sure use doxygen >= 1.7.2
  * make the files be owned by root:root before compressing them
